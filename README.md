```

> **NOTE 1:** On MacOS, git will not be installed (but you will prompted to install developer tools).

> **NOTE 2:** On MacOS, the above script may not succeed at first, you will need to reboot and run the script again in order for it to succeed.

### Installing Nix Flakes

## Bootstrapping System
### Darwin
You can bootstrap a new nix-darwin system using
